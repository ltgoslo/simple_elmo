_Simple_elmo_ is a Python library to work with pre-trained [ELMo embeddings](https://allennlp.org/elmo) in TensorFlow.

This is a significantly updated wrapper to the [original ELMo implementation](https://github.com/allenai/bilm-tf).
The main changes are:
- more convenient and transparent data loading (including from compressed files)
- code adapted to modern TensorFlow versions (including TensorFlow 2).

# Installation

`pip install --upgrade simple_elmo`

Make sure to update the package regularly, we are actively developing.

# Usage

 `from simple_elmo import ElmoModel`

 `model = ElmoModel()`

## Loading
 First, let's load a pretrained model from disk:

 `model.load(PATH_TO_ELMO)`

### Required arguments

 **PATH_TO_ELMO** is either a ZIP archive downloaded from the [NLPL vector repository](http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/),
OR a directory containing 2 files (for example, downloaded from [AllenNLP](https://allennlp.org/elmo)):
- `model.hdf5`, pre-trained ELMo weights in HDF5 format;
- `options.json`, description of the model architecture in JSON;

Optionally, one can also provide `vocab.txt`/`vocab.txt.gz`: 
a one-word-per-line vocabulary of words to be cached (as character id representations) before inference.
Even if it is not present at all, ELMo will still process all words normally.
However, providing the vocabulary file can slightly increase inference speed when working with very large corpora (by reducing the amount of word to char ids conversions).

### Optional arguments
- **top**: *bool, default False*
if this parameter is set to True, only the top (last) layer of the model will be used;
otherwise, the average of all 3 layers is produced.
- **max_batch_size**: *integer, default 96*
      the maximum number of sentences/documents in a batch during inference;
      your input will be automatically split into chunks of the respective size;
      if your computational resources allow, you might want to increase this value.
- **limit**: *integer, default 100*
the number of words from the vocabulary file to actually cache (counted from the first line). 
Increase the default value if you are sure these words occur in your training data much more often than 1 or 2 times. 

## Working with models
 Currently, we provide two methods for loaded models (will be expanded in the future):

 - `model.get_elmo_vectors(SENTENCES)`
 
 - `model.get_elmo_vector_average(SENTENCES)`

`SENTENCES` is a list of input sentences (lists of words).

The `get_elmo_vectors()` method produces a tensor of contextualized word embeddings.
Its shape is (number of sentences, the length of the longest sentence, ELMo dimensionality).

The `get_elmo_vector_average()` method produces a tensor with one vector per each input sentence,
constructed by averaging individual contextualized word embeddings. 
Its shape is (number of sentences, ELMo dimensionality).

Use these tensors for your downstream tasks.


# Example scripts

We provide two example scripts to make it easier to start using _simple_elmo_ right away:
- [Inferring token embeddings](https://github.com/ltgoslo/simple_elmo/blob/master/simple_elmo/examples/get_elmo_vectors.py)
 
`python3 get_elmo_vectors.py -i test.txt -e ~/PATH_TO_ELMO/`

- [Text pairs classification](https://github.com/ltgoslo/simple_elmo/blob/master/simple_elmo/examples/text_classification.py)

`python3 text_classification.py -i paraphrases_lemm.tsv.gz -e ~/PATH_TO_ELMO/`

The second script can be used to perform document pair classification (like in text entailment or paraphrase detection).
Simple average of ELMo embeddings for all words in a document is used;
then, the cosine similarity between two documents is calculated and used as a classifier feature.
Evaluated with macro F1 score and 10-fold cross-validation.

# Training your own ELMo
Currently we provide ELMo training code (updated and improved in the same way compared to the original implementation)
in a [separate repository](https://github.com/ltgoslo/simple_elmo_training).
It will be integrated into the _simple_elmo_ package in the nearest future.
